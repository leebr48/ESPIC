# Electrostatic particle-in-cell code (ESPIC)

ESPIC is capable of simulating the kinetic behavior of plasmas in the limit that the velocities of all particles are much less than the speed of light. To get started, please clone this repository and install ESPIC with `pip install .`. You can see how to use the code by looking in the `examples` directory. Documentation can be found [here](https://leebr48.github.io/ESPIC/).

FIXME you should both read over all the docs and ensure everything is correct before shipping.

FIXME do you want this README to be displayed on the front page of your docs? Do you know how to get anything else to display?
