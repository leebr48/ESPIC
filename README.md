# ESPIC
Electrostatic particle-in-cell code

FIXME should perhaps set specific versions of numpy, scipy, etc in pyproject.toml.

FIXME once code is done, figure out the minimum version of python needed and change requires-python in pyproject.toml as well as anywhere "3.8" appears in testing matrices, etc. Probably just grep "3.8" to find everything.

FIXME you should add instructions for use here.
