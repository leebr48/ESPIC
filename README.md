# Electrostatic particle-in-cell code (ESPIC)

FIXME should configure __init__.py to only expose classes/functions we want users to have access to. Might consider renaming everything else with a leading "_". Maybe???

FIXME should perhaps set specific versions of numpy, scipy, etc in pyproject.toml and environment.yml.

FIXME once code is done, figure out the minimum version of python needed and change requires-python in pyproject.toml as well as anywhere "3.8" appears in testing matrices, etc. Probably just grep "3.8" to find everything.

FIXME you should add instructions for use here.

FIXME you should probably clean up the commit history and commit messages at the very end.

FIXME make sure that your document building on Github Pages is working correctly!
