# Electrostatic particle-in-cell code (ESPIC)

ESPIC is capable of simulating the kinetic behavior of plasmas in the limit that the velocities of all particles are much less than the speed of light. To get started, please clone this repository and use `pip install .` to install ESPIC. You can see how to use the code by looking in the `examples` directory. Documentation can be found [here](https://leebr48.github.io/ESPIC/).
