# Electrostatic particle-in-cell code (ESPIC)

FIXME you should both read over all the docs and ensure everything is correct before shipping.

FIXME should perhaps set specific versions of numpy, scipy, etc in pyproject.toml and environment.yml.

FIXME once code is done, figure out the minimum version of python needed and change requires-python in pyproject.toml as well as anywhere "3.8" appears in testing matrices, etc. Probably just grep "3.8" to find everything.

FIXME do you want this README to be displayed on the front page of your docs? Do you know how to get anything else to display?

FIXME you should add instructions for use here.
