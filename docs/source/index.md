Welcome to the ESPIC documentation! ESPIC is capable of simulating the kinetic behavior of plasmas in the limit that the velocities of all particles are much less than the speed of light. When you are ready to download and use the code, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/leebr48/ESPIC).
